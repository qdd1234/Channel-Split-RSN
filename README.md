## 这里我们提供Pytorch 风格的代码


#### Note
* \+ means using ensemble models.
* All models are trained on 4 V100 GPUs

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Install Pytorch referring to [Pytorch website][2].

2. Clone this repo, and config **RSN_HOME** in **/etc/profile** or **~/.bashrc**, e.g.
 ```
 export RSN_HOME='/path/of/your/cloned/repo'
 export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$RSN_HOME
 ```

3. Install requirements:
 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```

4. Install COCOAPI referring to [cocoapi website][3], or:
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git $RSN_HOME/lib/COCOAPI
 cd $RSN_HOME/lib/COCOAPI/PythonAPI
 make install
 ```
 
### Dataset

#### COCO

1. Download images from [COCO website][4], and put train2014/val2014 splits into **$RSN_HOME/dataset/COCO/images/** respectively.

2. Download ground truth from [Google Drive][6] or [Baidu Drive][10] (code: fc51), and put it into **$RSN_HOME/dataset/COCO/gt_json/**.

3. Download detection result from [Google Drive][6] or [Baidu Drive][10] (code: fc51), and put it into **$RSN_HOME/dataset/COCO/det_json/**.



### Log
Create a directory to save logs and models:
```
mkdir $RSN_HOME/model_logs
```

### Train
Go to specified experiment repository, e.g.
```
cd $RSN_HOME/exps/RSN18.coco
```
and run:
```
python config.py -log
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=gpu_num train.py
```
the ***gpu_num*** is the number of gpus.

### Test
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=gpu_num test.py -i iter_num
```
the ***gpu_num*** is the number of gpus, and ***iter_num*** is the iteration number you want to test.
